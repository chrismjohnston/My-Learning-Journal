# Day 1 of Learning Linux

Everything in Linux is a file, even directories. Also there are no drives, or storage devices in Linux, they are simply devices mounted to a specific point in the file tree. If at any time you want to see where you are simply type the following command
<pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
It means *print working directory*

To list the contents of the directory type
<pre><code>ls</code></pre>

To change directories type
<pre><code>cd directory</code></pre>
directory meaning the one you want to change to.
