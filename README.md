# Learning Journal

This repo is where I'm keeping track of my Linux learning journey. This is largely following the layout of the book [*The Linux Command Line* by *William Shots*](https://github.com/chrismjohnston/My-Learning-Journal.git)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

I aim to learn more about the Linux OS and the command line
What I want to accomplish in the next 30 days:

- Learn about the Linux filesystem
- Learn to use the bash shell
- Manipulating file and directories
- Working with commands (executables, shell commands, shell functions, and aliases)
- Write articles about what I learned.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Track
